# Financial-Analysis

* My journey in analyzing the money markets/quant from stocks, major currencies like the dollar to crypto like BTC or Doge
* Heavy work involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and data cleansing to visualize trends especially during certain periods like 9/11, the pandemic and US elections

### Pyscript
* As we all are aware, is an open source web framework that let's you run Python in the web browser. What many are also not aware, is that you can add Matplotlib visualizations with the help of pyscript-HTML

# TODO
* Web scraping using financial APIs like Yahoo API
* Predictive modelling
