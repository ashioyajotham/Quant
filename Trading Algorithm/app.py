  There Are Two Ways to Build Algorithmic Trading Systems.
(Pro tip: If you don't want to wait until tomorrow for the next lesson, click the link at the bottom to get the next lesson in your inbox right away!)

# i) The first is data mining.

A trading system based on data mining looks for patterns in past price data and fits a model to them.

The only assumption is that the patterns of the past will repeat in the future. This is where most people start throwing in machine learning.

***********************Few successful trading systems are built through data mining***************************


# ii) The second is modeling market inefficiencies.

Model-based systems start with a model of a market inefficiency.

Inefficiencies can be based on trader psychology, economics, market microstructure, company events, or anything else that affects the price.

These inefficiencies cause patterns that deviate from the normal randomness of the market.

Sometimes, these patterns repeat and can be detected, predicted, and traded.

*******************************Most successful algorithmic trading systems are built by modeling market inefficiencies*************************

An edge is a market anomaly that consistently, and non-randomly, makes you money.

Algorithmic trading is a constant cycle of hypothesis formation and testing. This is why you learned Minimum Viable Python. 
You need to cycle through ideas as fast as you can since most of them will not work.
